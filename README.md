This is a personal project intended to help me learn the details of some standard machine learning algorithms. Initially I will implement a few naive algorithms, and then gradually introduce more complexity. As the code evolves, I will try to add (in comments) references to relevant journal articles or textbooks.

This project is not intended to replace, or to compete with any other open-source machine learning projects (e.g. xgboost, scikit-learn, etc.). It is strictly for educational and entertainment purposes.
